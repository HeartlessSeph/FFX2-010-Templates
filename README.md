# FFX2-010-Templates
A collection of 010 Editor templates for Final Fantasy X-2. Also includes a .csv character set for 010 editor so it can read FFX/X2's English strings (source received from shea093's FFX-2 Randomizer).

Most of the stuff in here was made from .h files left in FFX2's files by the developers. The majority of it seems to be based off of OG FFX2 so Creature related stuff had to be tested/guessed.
